## 📂 Problem Statement

Today, customers want to know:

* Where a product came from
* Whether it's genuine or fake
* If it's made ethically (no harmful practices)

But supply chains are complex:

* Product details get lost or manipulated
* Fake certifications are common
* No unified, tamper-proof history exists

This leads to counterfeiting, health risks, and loss of trust.

## ✅ Our Solution: TraceChain

We built **TraceChain**, a blockchain-powered platform to solve this:

* Every step (sourcing → production → packaging → delivery) is logged on a tamper-proof blockchain
* Businesses use the admin dashboard to record product data and generate blockchain-verified QR codes
* Consumers scan the QR code to verify product authenticity, certifications, and history

Result: **Full transparency and trust** for both consumers and businesses.
